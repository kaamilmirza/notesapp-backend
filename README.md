# Notes App Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for the Notes App project! This repository provides the server-side functionality for managing files, user authentication, and course creation. We encourage developers to contribute to this open-source project and be part of its growth and improvement.

## Project Description

The Notes App Backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, making it a powerful and scalable solution for handling API requests and managing data. It utilizes MongoDB as a NoSQL database for storing files and course information. The project also integrates with external services like Amazon S3 for file uploads and storage, and Firebase for user authentication.

## Getting Started

To contribute to the Notes App Backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the backend repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaamilmirza/notesapp-backend.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and provide the necessary environment variables. This includes configuration details for your MongoDB database, Amazon S3 credentials, and Firebase authentication.

4. **Explore the codebase**: Familiarize yourself with the project structure and key files:

- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the project, including environment variables and database connections.
- `controller/`: Implements the application logic and handles requests from the client.
- `middleware/`: Contains middleware functions for handling authentication and authorization.
- `models/`: Defines the data models used in the application, such as files and courses.
- `routes/`: Defines the API routes and their corresponding controller methods.
- `services/`: Implements the business logic and interacts with the database.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `package.json`: Contains the project's dependencies and scripts.
- `server.js`: The entry point of the application, responsible for starting the server and initializing the routes.

5. **Pick an area to contribute**: Identify an area within the project that you would like to work on or improve. It could be adding new features, enhancing existing functionality, fixing bugs, or optimizing performance.

6. **Create a new branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on. Use a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your contribution. For example:

```
git checkout -b feature/file-upload
```

7. **Make your changes**: Implement your changes or additions in the designated files. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding style and adheres to best practices.

8. **Test your changes**: Run the project locally and test your changes to ensure they function as expected. Write appropriate test cases if applicable.

9. **Commit and push**: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them with a meaningful commit message. Then, push your changes to the remote repository.

```
Example: 
git commit -m "Add file upload functionality"
git push origin feature/file-upload
```

10. **Create a pull request**: Go to the repository on GitHub and create a new pull request. Provide a clear description of the changes you made, the problem you solved, or the feature you added. Discuss and address any feedback or suggestions provided by the maintainers.

11. **Collaborate and iterate**: Work with the maintainers and other contributors to refine and enhance your contribution. Be open to feedback and suggestions, and actively participate in discussions.
